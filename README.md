# Remote-work-and-Mental-health
Impact of remote work on Mental health

### Project Overview

The main aim for this health data analysis project was to provide insights on the impact of remote work on the mental health of the employees.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Impact_of_Remote_Work_on_Mental_Health.csv" [Download_here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health/data)

### Tools

- Power query: Data cleaning and analysis
- Power Bi: Visualization

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In initial data preparation phase, the following tasks were carried out;
- Created a copy of the data
- Data inspection
- Age grouping
- Calculation of satisfaction rate

### Dashboarding

- Created charts to target each objectives
- Added slicers for filtering of the data

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The objectives involved exploring the dataset to answer key questions, such as;
- The role of support system?
- Differences by Work Environment?
- Productivity and Job Satisfaction?
- Impact on Work and quality of Sleep?

### Data Analysis

1. The role of support system: Focuses on analyzing how various support systems influence the mental health of remote workers.
2. Differences by Work Environment: Focuses on investigating how differences in home office environments impact mental health outcomes.
3. Productivity and Job Satisfaction: Focuses on how remote work affects productivity and job satisfaction, and the influence of mental health on these factors.
3. Impact on Work and quality of Sleep: Focuses on investigating how remote work influences employees' sleep quality and work balance.

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows;
- Younger employees report lower satisfaction, potentially due to perceived inadequate support from the company. This indicates that age or experience may play a role in employees' perception of support, impacting their overall satisfaction levels.

- There’s a direct link between higher hourly rates and increased exhaustion levels, suggesting that financial compensation alone might not mitigate the effects of burnout and could even exacerbate it if tied to long or intense working hours.

- The data shows that satisfaction alone does not guarantee productivity. Employees may feel content with their role or benefits but might still struggle with productivity due to other factors like workload, time management, or stress.

- There’s a minimal difference (0.02%) in performance outcomes between those who get good-quality sleep versus those who don’t, suggesting that sleep quality may not significantly impact performance in this context or could indicate that other factors weigh more heavily on productivity.

Enhance Support Programs for Younger Employees:
Mentorship Initiatives: Pair younger employees with more experienced mentors to foster support and professional development.
Clear Communication on Available Resources: Improve awareness of mental health, wellness, and professional resources for younger employees to ensure they feel supported.
Flexibility and Engagement Opportunities: Design programs that specifically address challenges younger employees face, such as work-life balance and career development.
