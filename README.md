### Project Overview

The main aim for this health data analysis project was to provide insights on the impact of remote work on the mental health of the employees.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Impact_of_Remote_Work_on_Mental_Health.csv" [Download_here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health/data)

### Tools

- Power query: Data cleaning and analysis
- Power Bi: Visualization

### Data Preparation

In initial data preparation phase, the following tasks were carried out;
- Created a copy of the data
- Data inspection
- Age grouping
- Calculation of satisfaction rate

### Dashboarding

- Created charts to target each objectives
- Added slicers for filtering of the data

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The objectives involved exploring the dataset to answer key questions, such as;
- The role of support system?
- Differences by Work Environment?
- Productivity and Job Satisfaction?
- Impact on Work and quality of Sleep?

### Data Analysis

1. The role of support system: Focuses on analyzing how various support systems influence the mental health of remote workers.
2. Differences by Work Environment: Focuses on investigating how differences in home office environments impact mental health outcomes.
3. Productivity and Job Satisfaction: Focuses on how remote work affects productivity and job satisfaction, and the influence of mental health on these factors.
3. Impact on Work and quality of Sleep: Focuses on investigating how remote work influences employees' sleep quality and work balance.

### Results or Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows;
- Younger employees report lower satisfaction, potentially due to perceived inadequate support from the company. This indicates that age or experience may play a role in employees' perception of support, impacting their overall satisfaction levels.

- There’s a direct link between higher hourly rates and increased exhaustion levels, suggesting that financial compensation alone might not mitigate the effects of burnout and could even exacerbate it if tied to long or intense working hours.

- The data shows that satisfaction alone does not guarantee productivity. Employees may feel content with their role or benefits but might still struggle with productivity due to other factors like workload, time management, or stress.

- There’s a minimal difference (0.02%) in performance outcomes between those who get good-quality sleep versus those who don’t, suggesting that sleep quality may not significantly impact performance in this context or could indicate that other factors weigh more heavily on productivity.

### Recommendation

Based on the analysis, the following actions are reccommended;
- Enhance Support Programs for Younger Employees:
  - Mentorship Initiatives: Pair younger employees with more experienced mentors to foster support and professional development.
  - Clear Communication on Available Resources: Improve awareness of mental health, wellness, and professional resources for younger employees to ensure they feel supported.
  - Flexibility and Engagement Opportunities: Design programs that specifically address challenges younger employees face, such as work-life balance and career development.
- Manage Workloads to Reduce Exhaustion:
  - Limit Overtime and Encourage Breaks: For roles with higher hourly rates, limit overtime and promote a culture where taking breaks is encouraged to prevent exhaustion.
  - Introduce Mental Health Days or Downtime Allowances: Offer employees days off or lighter tasks to recharge, which can enhance productivity in the long term.
  - Redefine Compensation Structure: Consider rewarding productivity through non-monetary perks (such as flexible hours or remote work days) to offset the pressure of high hourly expectations.
- Address Factors Beyond Satisfaction for Improved Productivity:
  - Goal Setting and Accountability: Help employees set achievable goals and track progress. Providing regular feedback and recognizing accomplishments could positively impact productivity beyond satisfaction levels.
  - Skill Development and Training: Offer training focused on time management, stress management, and role-specific skills to improve productivity.
- Encourage Healthy Sleep Habits: Educate employees on the benefits of good sleep, even if direct productivity benefits are marginal, as this can improve overall well-being.
- Since the sleep quality difference showed minimal impact, research exploring other lifestyle or mental health factors that could be contributing to productivity challenges should further investigated.
*These recommendations aim to foster a healthier, more supportive work environment that balances employee satisfaction, productivity, and well-being.*

### Limitations
- The data represents only a specific period, it may not capture fluctuations over time (e.g., seasonal workload changes, evolving company policies).
- The analysis may reveal correlations (e.g., between high hourly rates and exhaustion), but it doesn’t confirm causation. Other underlying factors (like job type, workload, or personal health) might be influencing both hourly rate and exhaustion simultaneously.
- Since satisfaction, exhaustion, and mental health factors are often self-reported, responses may be influenced by personal biases, mood at the time of the survey, or reluctance to report burnout.
